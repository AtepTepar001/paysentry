# PaySentry Growth Experiment — Quick Reference

## Phase 1 Results (Early Feb 2026)

**Effort:** 32 hours | **Budget:** $0 | **Traction:** Near-zero

| Channel | Result | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| GitHub | 3 stars | ❌ |
| Dev.to | 0 views | ❌ |
| Twitter/X | 26 impressions, 1 like | ❌ |
| Hacker News | 2 points | ❌ |
| Moltbook | 2,759 bot comments (spam) | ❌ |
| npm | Early-stage, no downloads yet | ⚠️ |
| Blog | Untracked | ❌ |
| Landing Page | <10 visitors | ❌ |

### Why It Failed
1. **Content quality ≠ market traction** — Good articles, unknown product
2. **"Spray and pray" doesn't work for unknown products** — Noise on 8 channels = noise everywhere
3. **Moltbook spam destroyed credibility** — 2,759 bot comments = community flagged it as spam
4. **SDK incomplete** — Package published but no real integrations, no dashboard
5. **Problem visibility is the blocker** — Enterprises don't know agents can spend money yet

## Phase 2 Strategy: Product-Driven Growth (Feb-April 2026)

**From:** Broadcast to unknown audience
**To:** Deep engagement with developers actively solving the problem

### Target Audiences (Priority Order)
1. **x402 / coinbase teams** — See 125+ payment issues, know this is broken
2. **MCP server builders** — Publishing payment-enabled agents right now
3. **AI research labs** — Running multi-agent experiments with real spend
4. **Enterprise AI ops** — Managing agent deployments, compliance coming

### 6-Week Execution Plan

| Week | Focus | Effort | Success Signal |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 1-4 | **x402 Adapter** — Real integration (not mock) | 40-60 hrs | x402 team aware, adapter works |
| 1-8 | **Community Participation** — x402 GitHub issues | 5-10 hrs/wk | 50+ comments, 5+ conversations |
| 2-6 | **MCP Payment Server** — Reference implementation | 30-50 hrs | Published, 3+ MCP builders know about it |
| 1-8 | **Content Strategy** — SEO (not broadcast) | 4-6 hrs/wk | 5,000 monthly views, rank for "x402 timeout" |
| 3-8 | **Beta Users** — 5-10 early adopters | 20-30 hrs | Use cases documented, feedback collected |
| 1-12 | **GitHub Presence** — Make paysentry the reference | 15-20 hrs setup | 50+ stars, 3+ community PRs |

### Success Metrics

#### Primary (North Star)
- GitHub Stars: 3 → **75** (25x growth)
- Active Beta Users: 0 → **10**
- npm Weekly Downloads: 0 → **200+**
- x402 GitHub Mentions: 0 → **30+**
- Blog Views/Month: 0 → **3,000+**

#### Checkpoints
- **Week 2:** x402 adapter functional + 5+ issue comments → GO
- **Week 4:** MCP server published + 3 beta users → GO
- **Week 8:** 75 stars + 10 users + 2+ case studies → Phase 2b

## Key Insight

**The problem is real, the market is small.** The 125+ x402 issues, Deloitte governance stats, and EU AI Act prove it. But only ~50 teams worldwide are actively building agent payment systems right now. Phase 2 focuses on reaching *those teams*, not broadcasting to the world.

If we hit 75 stars + 10 beta users by Week 8, we've found product-market fit with early movers. Then we can expand.

## Phase 2 Roadmap

1. **x402 Integration** — Work with x402 team on real issues
2. **MCP Ecosystem** — Become the standard for payment-enabled MCP servers
3. **Content** — Own SEO for high-intent keywords (x402 debugging, MCP payments, agent spending)
4. **Community** — Get 5-10 real developers using PaySentry as production middleware
5. **Platform** — Expand to AP2, Visa TAP, enterprise features (if traction validates)

**Status:** Ready for Week 1
**Next Review:** 2026-02-14
